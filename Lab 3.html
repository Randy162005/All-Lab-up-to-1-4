        <p>This image is the perfect description of my Hobby.
        <p>I decided to put a picture of someone on the bank fishing because that is mostly what I do.</p>
        <p>This picture shows someone fishing on a sunny day, hoping to get a bite.</p>
        <p>The image is relaxing , which is why fishing is a hobby that I enjoy.</p>

        <p>This audio is someone that decided to go fishing and looking to catch a bass.</p>
        <p>In the audio he talks about what type of lure he is using. He decided on a texas rig senko.</p>
        <p>He than talks about how he rigs the lure into the hook.</p>
        <p>He than ends his day catching a bass describing the weight and size.</p>
        <img src="Images/SenkoFish.jpg"/>
        <p>In this photo we see a fish that has been caught.</p>
        <P>We see that the person is lipping the bass with their thumb, which is the correct way to hold a bass.</P>
        <p>If you look at the image the fish has something in it's mouth that looks like a worm.</p>
        <p>That plastic bait is used to mimic bait fish under water that bass typically eat. This type of lure is very popular</p>

<p>In this video it shows how a senko looks underwater.</p>
<p>The video shows the fish getting ready to attack the lure.</p>
<p>The fisherman than waits 3 seconds to set the hook and start reeling in the bass.</p>
<p>This video is the perfect example if people ever wonder what the fish see underwater.</p>
